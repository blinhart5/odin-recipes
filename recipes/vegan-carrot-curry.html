        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A warm, comforting vegan soup, with hints of curry</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Cups Vegetable Broth</li>
            <li>2 tsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp gound ginger</li>
            <li>2 lbs carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can coconut milk</li>
            <li>14 ounces water</li>
            <li>1 tsp chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the vegetable broth into a soup pot, and bring to a boil over medium heat.
                    Stir in the curry powder, cumin, cinnamon, and ginger; add the carrots.
                    Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the carrots are tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often.</li>
                <li>Strain out the carrots from the broth, and place carrots into a blender,
                    filling the pitcher no more than halfway full.
                    Pour about 1/4 cup vegetable broth into the blender to allow the carrots to puree.
                    Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel,
                    and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the carrots moving before leaving it on to puree.
                    Puree in batches until smooth, if needed; return the pureed carrots to the vegetable broth.
                    Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the carrots right in the cooking pot.</li>
                <li>Stir in the coconut milk and the water (use the coconut milk can to measure). Bring back to a simmer; sprinkle with cilantro to serve.</li>
            </ol>
